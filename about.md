### Help file for Coursera Data Science Capstone Project

The goal of this exercise is to create an application to highlight the prediction algorithm being built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. 



#### The Objective

Build a shiny application that is capable of predicting the next word. 

Text data used to create a frequency dictionary and predict the next words comes from a corpus called [HC Corpora](http://www.corpora.heliohost.org/). 

Text mining and natural language processing was done using R packages.



#### The Usage Of The Application

The user interface of this application takes text input e.g. (**1**). The field with the predicted next word refreshes instantaneously e.g. (**2**) while the text input (**1**) continues to get displayed.



#### Additional Information

The whole code of this application, as well as all the milestone report, related scripts, this presentation  etc. can be found in this GitHub repo:
